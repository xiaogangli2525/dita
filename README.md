# DITA Lite Client

A lightweight local web client for reading, editing, reviewing, and exporting DITA documents.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start          # starts on http://127.0.0.1:5050
npm test           # unit and HTTP workflow regression tests
npm run dev        # disposable sample workspace for trying the UI
```

Requires **Node.js 20+** and **Git**. `npm start` edits the repository configured by `DOCS_ROOT`; `npm run dev` uses temporary sample documents and deletes them when the demo stops.

## Dependencies

- **iconv-lite** — used for GBK/GB2312/GB18030 encoding round-trip. DITA files
  with encoding="GBK" are read via TextDecoder and written back via
  iconv-lite.encode() so Chinese text is preserved on save. Without this
  dependency, GBK files would be silently converted to UTF-8 and corrupted.

## Key Features

- Author mode: visual editing with Oxygen tracked-change support
- Review mode: side-by-side diff with accept/reject per change block
- Map view: edit entire ditamap with all referenced topics
- HTML export: single-file HTML with embedded images, TOC, notes
- Markdown export: DITA to Markdown with syntax-highlighted preview
- Image path resolution: resolves relative hrefs against topic directory
- GBK encoding: preserves declared encoding on save
- Reliability: conflict-aware atomic saves, protected branch switching, stale-tab rejection
- Security: Origin validation, real-path containment, asset whitelist, streaming body limit
- Export includes current working buffers; local images are embedded in HTML and Markdown
- Map structure operations are undoable edits; use Save to write them to disk

## Workflow and architecture

The light workspace separates document navigation, editing and the attribute/review panel. Advanced editing tools are grouped in a dropdown; narrow screens use navigation and inspector drawers.

- `public/document-store.js`: save coordination and provider-independent edit proposals.
- `public/workspace-client.js`: workspace identity and stale-response handling.
- `public/export.js`: export snapshots, resource loading and preview/download orchestration.
- `public/app-core.js`: XML/Author/review/conversion algorithms.
- `lib/document-files.js`: encoding, real-path containment and atomic file writes.
- `lib/workspace-lock.js`: concurrent reads with exclusive saves/workspace switches.

Branch switching refuses a dirty Git worktree, including changes already saved by the editor. Commit or stash those changes with Git first. A failed save never intentionally replaces newer working text; download your working copy before reopening a file with a disk conflict.

The HTTP API requires the `workspaceToken` returned by `/api/workspace` in the `x-workspace-token` header for document operations. Updates also require `expectedContent`, the last-read disk content. This is a local single-workspace application, not a shared multi-user server. `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` can explicitly allow a trusted reverse-proxy origin; default access remains localhost.
