# Verification

Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm test` with Node 20 or later and Git installed.

The regression suite covers:

- XML/GBK round trips, source-preserving Author edits, Oxygen review and bounded diff algorithms.
- Save acknowledgements arriving after newer edits; failed saves preserving the working copy.
- Nested Git paths, dirty branch-switch refusal, disk conflicts, safe create/overwrite and symbolic-link boundaries through real HTTP requests against temporary Git repositories.
- Workspace identity rotation and stale-response rejection, including body decoding after a switch.
- Export orchestration using current buffers and embedded images; missing-image failures and early-return loading cleanup.
- Future AI proposal validation, stale-base rejection, explicit application and undo.

`npm run dev` starts a disposable example Git workspace. Use it for manual browser checks; `npm start` opens real documents according to `DOCS_ROOT`.

Browser checklist:

1. Open a topic; switch Source/Author/Reading and edit text.
2. Save; verify the pending badge clears while Git review still shows the edit.
3. Type during a delayed save; verify the newer input stays dirty.
4. Open a Map, edit a topic and export without saving; verify current text and embedded local images.
5. Open an invalid/non-Map export and verify the loading indicator clears.
6. Change a Map node; undo; verify neither action writes to disk until Save.
7. Open two tabs, switch workspace in one, and verify the old tab cannot write into it.
8. Check desktop and a 390px iframe/viewport: navigation and inspector open/close, document content remains scrollable, and no horizontal page overflow appears.

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the suite on Node 20 and 22. Browser checks are manual, not automated by this workflow.

## Checks performed for this change

- All 67 automated tests passed locally (Node 24); CI is configured for Node 20 and 22.
- Browser: desktop topic open, Source edit/save, Git diff review, Map Author, HTML preview and Map reorder/undo passed.
- Responsive: 390 × 844 CSS-pixel iframe checked for document navigation, automatic drawer close and scrollable Author content. This is responsive layout verification, not a mobile-device compatibility certification.
